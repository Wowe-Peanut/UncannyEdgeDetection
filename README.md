# UncannyEdgeDetection

<p>
I wanted to learn more about how edge-detection programs work so I followed the wikipedia page on Canny Edge Detection to make my own in python. I won't bother going over how the program works here; read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector">Wikipedia Page</a> on canny edge detection if you're interested.

It's not great, but it's also not too bad. It does a decent job at picking up edges while ignoring noise and another non-edge color changes but is quite slow (although I havn't actually compared it to other programs). I also added the option to edge trace GIFs by parsing and tracing each frame individually then combining them back into a new gif.
